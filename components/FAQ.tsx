              If you have a flat tire, safely pull over to the side of the road. Turn on your hazard lights and set up warning triangles or flares if available. Locate your spare tire, jack, and lug wrench in the trunk. Follow the instructions in your owner's manual to safely change the tire. If you're unsure or uncomfortable changing the tire yourself, contact roadside assistance for help.

Check the coolant level and top it off if necessary (after the engine has cooled). If you're unsure about handling the situation, contact roadside assistance for help. Driving with an overheating engine can cause severe damage to your vehicle.
